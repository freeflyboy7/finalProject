      <h3>Learning as I go along</h3>
      <p class="intro">Some of us have no idea what we want to do with our lives. Even after we finish school, after we get a job ,after we’re making money or not . Between ages 16 and 24, I changed career ideas more often than I changed my tooth-brush. And even after I had an idea, it wasn’t until I was 33 that I kinda (I think?) found what I wanted for my life.

      Maybe you’re like me and have no idea what you want to do. It’s a thing almost every person goes through. “What do I want to do with my life?” “What do I like to do?” “What don't I want to do?”.

      Some part of the problem is the idea of “ the purpose of life”. The idea that we were born for some purpose and it’s now our life mission to go out and get it. As I like to say "Who made up that rule?"<div id="share-buttons">

      <h3>What I did before I came to <a href="http://nycda.com/">NYCDA</a></h3>
      <p class="intro">All the jobs I held brought me alot of satisfaction, because I was able to see the end result by the customers reaction to what I have presented to them. I try to listen to others and learn from there experiences. This way of thinking have led me into being happy. I attended college for a bit, I have had numerous jobs some I worked for a few months or years. I was deli-counter person, busperson, waiter, pizza men , bartender, roofer, snapple delivery person, a glass mechanic, heating airconditioning ventilation mechanic, brick paver, skydiver instructor. Now I will give Computer coding a try. I wish to learn and do more, that is why I came to <a href="http://nycda.com/">NYCDA</a>. Now I am half way through the course and its going well. What I enjoy most of all is writing a piece of code that I can see what I have built instantly. <strong> Remember we are never to old to learn something new. We are students for life.</strong> </p>

      <div id="demo" class="collapse">
         I got lucky and found a job in a Mom and Pop pizza restaurant. The owners were great and the waitress who I worked with took me under their wings and showed me the ropes, learned alot about making dough, cooking, serving and dealing with people in general. From there I went to other places with a solid work experience.

      <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
        I was introduced on how to work with plate glass of all different thickness,colors and size. I learned how to cut glass, shaping different kind of edges, I made mirrors from scratch, gold vain, smoke mirrors , and color glass for various installations. Its was rewarding because a person would request something that they made up ,and then I was able to produce what the customer wanted.

        One of the best and scariest jobs that I ever held, but after hundreds of jumps I became a coach and then a tandem instructor. It was a mind game most of the time, here is this person who signed up for this scary exciting experience and now I was incharge of taking this person into an unknown. This was alot of phycological evaluation on my part, to make sure that the passenger felt safe with me along this experience, I got to meet alot of people and their reasons for skydiving.

        This job was tough, working in crawl spaces under houses or in super hot attics in the peak heat of summmer, but in the end I was satisfied to see customers were happy because I was able to get the air conditioning or heat back on.
